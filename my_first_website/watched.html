            <p>Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day. Raised together as children, they came
                to know of the "Wizard King"—a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and promised that they
                would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard King. However, as they grew up, the
                stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and
                control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by training physically.

                When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while
                Asta receives nothing. However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a person named Lebuty, whose main
                purpose is to obtain Yuno's Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched. Though without
                hope and on the brink of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he hears Yuno's voice.
                Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a "Black Clover"
                giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days later, the two friends head out into the world,
                both seeking the same goal—to become the Wizard King!</p>

                Takemichi Hanagaki's second year of middle school was the highest point in his life. He had respect, a
                gang of friends he could count on, and even a girlfriend. But that was twelve years ago. Today, he's a
                nobody: a washed-up nonentity made fun of by children and always forced to apologize to his younger
                boss. A sudden news report on the Tokyo Manji Gang's cruel murder of the only girlfriend he ever had
                alongside her brother only adds insult to injury. Half a second before a train ends his pitiful life for
                good, Takemichi flashes back to that same day 12 years ago, when he was still dating Hinata Tachibana.

                After being forced to relive the very same day that began his downward spiral, Takemichi meets Hinata's
                younger brother. Without thinking, he admits to his seeming death before flashing back to the past.
                Takemichi urges him to protect his sister before inexplicably returning to the future. Miraculously, he
                is not dead. Stranger still, the future has changed. It seems as though Takemichi can alter the flow of
                time. Given the chance to prevent his ex-girlfriend's tragic death at the hands of the Tokyo Manji Gang,
                Takemichi decides to fly through time to change the course of the future.</p>

            <p>Shuuichi Kagaya is what one would consider an average high school student, but sometimes, he turns into a
                monster. He doesn't know how or why he got his abilities, only that he would prefer no one knows about
                them. One night, he finds a building ablaze with a girl trapped inside. Deciding to save her, he
                transforms and carries her to safety, but accidentally drops his phone.

                The next day, the girl he saved—Claire Aoki—finds him and confronts him about his monster identity. She
                even goes so far as to push him off the school roof to prove her theory after Shuuichi denies her
                allegations. Desperate to save himself, he transforms, and Claire snaps a picture in order to blackmail
                him into telling her everything he knows about monsters, which, ironically, isn't much.

            <p>kou Yamori is an average middle school student who struggles with grasping the complex concept of love.
                Because he sees little sense in surrendering to the norm, he soon stops going to school. Plagued with
                insomnia due to his idleness, Kou begins roaming the lonesome streets at night.

                One night, Kou encounters a bizarre girl named Nazuna Nanakusa who believes that people stay awake
                during the night because they are dissatisfied with how they spent their day and cannot rest until they
                release their inhibitions. Nazuna offers to help Kou with his sleep issues and invites him over to her
                place, where she convinces him to share a futon with her. Feeling uncomfortable, Kou only pretends to
                doze off—which is when Nazuna suddenly bites his neck, revealing herself to be a vampire!</p>

            <p>For weeks, Atsushi Nakajima's orphanage has been plagued by a mystical tiger that only he seems to be
                unaware of. Suspected to be behind the strange incidents, the 18-year-old is abruptly kicked out of the
                orphanage and left hungry, homeless, and wandering through the city.

                While starving on a riverbank, Atsushi saves a rather eccentric man named Osamu Dazai from drowning.
                Whimsical suicide enthusiast and supernatural detective, Dazai has been investigating the same tiger
                that has been terrorizing the boy. Together with Dazai's partner Doppo Kunikida, they solve the mystery,
                but its resolution leaves Atsushi in a tight spot. As various odd events take place, Atsushi is coerced
                into joining their firm of supernatural investigators, taking on unusual cases the police cannot handle,
                alongside his numerous enigmatic co-workers.</p>
