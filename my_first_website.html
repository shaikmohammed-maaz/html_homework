<h1>hachiman hikigaya </h1>

        <br> <h3>
        <p style="border: #0b0b0b;">Hachiman is a teenage boy of average height and build. He has medium-short black hair and an ahoge. His most prominent feature is a set of dead fish-eyes. He does not wear his uniform up to school standards; he omits the tie and wears a black shirt underneath the dress shirt.

            In the light novel, Yukino Yukinoshita states that she criticized Hachiman's facial expression, not his facial features. This implies that, if not for his dead fish-eyes and gloomy expression, he would be fairly attractive, if not handsome.

          <img src = "Houtarou_Oreki.webp">
 <h3>  <p>Houtarou Oreki (折木 奉太郎 Oreki Hōtarō) is the protagonist of Classic Literature Club and Hyouka series. He is a student of Kamiyama High School, and a member of the school's Classic Lit Club. Houtarou is an apathetic person who prioritizes energy conservation above all else. Since he possesses brilliant deduction skills, he is often forced to use them by the ever-curious Eru Chitanda. <br>
to be honest he is really amazing in not giving a shit about any thing thats why i like him hes awsome...</p></h3>

<h3><p>Tanaka has a slender physique with short, fluffy dark-brown hair (colored black in the anime series). The left and right side of his bangs are swept toward his ears, though the middle falls between his eyes. His black-colored eyes often appear to be dull. He is usually seen wearing an apathetic expression. He is described to be handsome and prince-like by Oota's younger sister, so it can be thought that Tanaka is more good-looking than one might come to expect of his character.<br>
i like him because he also doesn't want to waste his energy on useless things so he soo listless that i wanna be like him in some way..:>   </p></h3>
